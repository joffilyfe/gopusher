# Go Pusher

Web push is a new way to send notifications to web users through browsers. This process is very much like push notification on smartphones. The specification is under development and I do not recommend you use it on production yet.

This project is a result of one week's study of RFC, Go lang encryption. I am not perfect and I hope I can continue maintain it. For the next round I will imporve the modularity with design patterns.

For now you can read these links to understand more about Web Push and come back to help.

## Why Go lang?
Golang is a language statically linked, fast and concurrent. It is in my radar for some time and this project ask for one language like that.
